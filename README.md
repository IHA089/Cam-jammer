Jam CCTV Camera using DOS attack

This Python code simulates jamming of CCTV cameras by continuously sending random UDP packets to the specified IP address and ports. By flooding the network with a high volume of random data packets, the script aims to overwhelm the CCTV cameraâ€™s processing capabilities and network bandwidth, potentially disrupting its ability to transmit video frames effectively.
